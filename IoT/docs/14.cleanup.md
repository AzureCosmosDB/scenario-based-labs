### Task 1: Delete the resource group

1. Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the Resource group you used throughout this hands-on lab by selecting Resource groups in the left menu.

2. Search for the name of your resource group, and select it from the list.

3. Select Delete in the command bar, and confirm the deletion by re-typing the resource group name, and selecting Delete.

You should follow the above steps _after_ completing the Hands-on lab, as all resources you deployed for the lab **will be deleted**.
