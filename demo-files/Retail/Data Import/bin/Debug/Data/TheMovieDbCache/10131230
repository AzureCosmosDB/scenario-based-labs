Attending other conventions across the country and speaking with legendary creators such as Kevin Eastman, Stan Lee and George R.R. Martin, the trio not only begins to find answers to why people gravitate towards superheroes and stories about superheroes, but how being a geek could help them live deeper, richer lives. Geek, and You Shall Find tells the stories behind the creation of several popular stories including Superman, Star Wars, Game of Thrones and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In sharing how these characters and their worlds came to be, creators reveal how often they have been inspired by real-life social ills. Most importantly, by continuing to speak with fans who have been inspired by these creations, this film reveals how superheroes have the potential to combat these social issues as well.","poster_path":"/pB0eOZRnUlyfcvmaKXhbdStV4CO.jpg","release_date":"2019-07-23","title":"Geek, and You Shall Find","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"popularity":1.407}],"person_results":[],"tv_results":[],"tv_episode_results":[],"tv_season_results":[]}
